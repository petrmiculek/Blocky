    === Public Attributes ===
    position:
        The (x, y) coordinates of the upper left corner of this Block.
        Note that (0, 0) is the top left corner of the window.
    size:
        The height and width of this Block.  Since all blocks are square,
        we needn't represent height and width separately.
    colour:
        If this block is not subdivided, <colour> stores its colour.
        Otherwise, <colour> is None and this block's sublocks store their
        individual colours.
    level:
        The level of this block within the overall block structure.
        The outermost block, corresponding to the root of the tree,
        is at level zero.  If a block is at level i, its children are at
        level i+1.
    max_depth:
        The deepest level allowed in the overall block structure.
    highlighted:
        True iff the user has selected this block for action.
    children:
        The blocks into which this block is subdivided.  The children are
        stored in this order: upper-right child, upper-left child,
        lower-left child, lower-right child.
    parent:
        The block that this block is directly within.

    === Representation Invariations ===
    - len(children) == 0 or len(children) == 4
    - If this Block has children,
        - their max_depth is the same as that of this Block,
        - their size is half that of this Block,
        - their level is one greater than that of this Block,
        - their position is determined by the position and size of this Block,
          as defined in the Assignment 2 handout, and
